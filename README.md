# Teach2000

## Introduction
Teach2000 is a Java programme offering a way to study word lists in a digital environment.  

It was created as a school project for the third part of the Java Programming 1 course of the first bachelor year in applied informatics at Karel de Grote University College.  

## Technology 
This project uses Java 8 and the JavaFX framework. No third party libraries are necessary: all file IO is done through the native Java API.
